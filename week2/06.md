# Chapter 6. Testing Overview

-       Testing: Concepts & Process

-       Testing Related Questions

-       Major Testing Techniques

# Testing and QA Alternatives

-   Defect and QA:

	- Defect: error/fault/failure.
    - Defect prevention/removal/containment.
    - Map to major QA activities

-       Defect prevention:

# Error blocking and error source removal.

-       Defect removal:

	-	Testing { Part II, Ch.6-12.
	-	Inspection, etc.

-       Defect containment: Fault tolerance and failure containment (safety assurance).

# QA and Testing

-       Testing as part of QA:

	- Activities focus on testing phase
	- QA/testing in waterfall and V-models

		(Fig 4.1, p.45 and Fig 4.2, p.49)

	- One of the most important part of QA

		- defect removal: Fig 3.1 (p.30)

-       Testing: Key questions:

	- Why: quality demonstration vs. defect detection and removal
	- How: techniques/activities/process/etc.
	- View: functional/external/black-box vs. structural/internal/white-box
	- Exit: coverage vs. usage-based

# Testing: Why?

-       Original purpose: demonstration of proper behavior or quality demonstration.

	~ "testing" in traditional settings.
	-	 evidence of quality or proper behavior.

-       New purpose: defect detection & removal:

	- mostly defect-free software manufacturing vs. traditional manufacturing.

	- flexibility of software (ease of change; sometimes, curse of change/flexibility)

	- failure observation => fault removal.

		 (defect detection => defect fixing)

	- eclipsing original purpose

# Testing: How

-       How? Run-observe-followup

		(particularly in case of failure observations)

-       Refinement

		=> generic process below (Fig 6.1, p.69)

-       Generic testing process as instantiation of SQE process in Fig 5.1, p.54.

# Testing: Activities & Generic Process

-       Major testing activities:

	- test planning and preparation
	- execution (testing)
	- analysis and followup

-       Link above activities ) generic process:

	- planning-execution-analysis-feedback.
	- entry criteria: typically external.
	- exit criteria: internal and external.
	- some (small) process variations

		- but we focus on strategies/techniques.

# Testing: Planning and Preparation

-       Test planning:

	- goal setting based on customers’ quality perspectives and expectations.
	- overall strategy based on the above and product/environmental characteristics.

-       Test preparation:

	- preparing test cases/suites:

		- typically based on formal models.

	- preparing test procedure.

-       More details in Chapter 7.

# Testing: Execution

-       General steps in test execution

	- allocating test time (& resources)
	- invoking test
	- identifying system failures (& gathering info. for followup actions)

-       Key to execution: handling both normal vs. abnormal cases

-       Activities closely related to execution:

	- failure identification:

		test oracle problem

	- data capturing and other measurement

-       More details in Chapter 7.

# Testing: Analysis and Followup

-       Analysis of testing results:

	- result checking (as part of execution)
	- further result analyses

		- defect/reliability/etc. analyses.

	- other analyses: defect ~ other metrics.

-       Followup activities:

	- feedback based analysis results.
	- immediate: defect removal (& re-test)
	- other followup (longer term):

		- decision making (exit testing, etc.)
		- test process improvement, etc.

-       More details in Chapter 7 (for activities) and Part IV (for mechanisms/models/etc.).

# Testing: How?

-       How to test?

		-	refine into three sets of questions

	- basic questions
	- testing technique questions
	- activity/management questions

-       Basic questions addressed in Ch.6:

	- What artifacts are tested?
	- What to test?

		- from which view?
		- related: type of faults found?

	- When to stop testing?

# Testing Technique Questions

-       Testing technique questions:

	- specific technique used?
	- systematic models used?

		- related model questions (below)

	- adapting technique from other domains?
	- integration for efficiency/effectiveness"?

-       Testing model questions:

	- underlying structure of the model?

		- main types: list vs. FSM?

	- how are these models used?
	- model extension?

-       Major techniques: Chapters 8-11.

# Test Activity/Management Questions

-       Addressed already: Generic process and relation to QA and software processes.

-       Other activity/management questions:

	- Who performs which specific activities?
	- When can specific activities be performed?
	- Test automation? What about tools?
	- Artifacts used for test management?
	- General environment for testing?
	- Product type/segment?

-       Most questions answered in Chapter 7.

	Integration issues addressed in Chapter 12.

# Functional vs. Structural Testing

-       Key distinction: Perspective on what need to be checked/tested.

-       Functional testing:

	- tests external functions.

		- as described by external specifications

	- black-box in nature;

		- functional mapping: input ) output
		- without involving internal knowledge

-       Structural testing:

	- tests internal implementations.

		- components and structures.

	- white-box in nature;

		- "white" here = seeing through

			=> internal elements visible.

	- really clear/glass/transparent box.

# Black-Box vs. White-Box View

-       Object abstraction/representation:

	- high-level: whole system ~ black-box.
	- low-level: individual statements, data, and other elements ~ white-box.

	- middle-levels of abstraction:

		- function/subroutine/procedure, module, subsystem, etc.

		- method, class, super-class, etc.

-       Gray-box (mixed black-/white-) testing:

	- many of the middle levels of testing.
	- example: procedures in modules

		- procedures individually as black box,
		- procedure interconnection ~ white-box at module level.

# White-box Testing

-       Program component/structure knowledge

	(or implementation details)

	- statement/component checklist
	- path (control flow) testing
	- data (flow) dependency testing

-       Applicability

	- test in the small/early
	- dual role of programmers/testers
	- can also model specifications

-       Criterion for stopping

	- mostly coverage goals.
	- occasionally quality/reliability goals.

# Black-box Testing

-       Input/output behavior

	- specification checklist.
	- testing expected/specified behavior

		- finite-state machines (FSMs)

	-	 white-box technique on specification
		- functional execution path testing.

-       Applicability

	- late in testing: system testing etc.
	- suitable for IV&V
	- compatible with OO/Reuse paradigm

-       Criteria: when to stop

	- traditional: functional coverage
	- usage-based: reliability target

# When to Stop Testing

-       Resource-based criteria:

	- Stop when you run out of time.
	- Stop when you run out of money.
	- Irresponsible ) quality/other problems.

-       Quality-based criteria:

	- Stop when quality goals reached.
	- Direct quality measure: reliability

		- resemble actual customer usages
		
	- Indirect quality measure: coverage.
	- Other surrogate: activity completion.
	- Above in decreasing desirability.

# Usage-Based Testing and OP

-       Usage-based statistical testing:

	- actual usage and scenarios/information
	- captured in operational profiles (OPs)
	- simulated in testing environment

		(too numerous => random sampling)

-       Applicability

	- final stages of testing.
	- particularly system/acceptance testing.
	- use with s/w reliability engineering.

-       Termination criteria: reliability goals

# Coverage-Based Testing

-       Coverage-based testing:

	- systematic testing based on formal (BBT/WBT) models and techniques
	- coverage measures defined for models
	- testing managed by coverage goals

-       Applicability

	- all stages of testing.
	- particularly unit and component testing.
	- later phases at high abstraction levels.

-       Termination criteria: coverage goals

# Steps in Systematic Testing

-       Instantiation of Fig 6.1 (p.69), but,

	- with a formalized strategies/goals,
	- based on formal models and techniques,
	- managed by termination criteria.

-       Steps in model construction and usage:

	- Define the model, usually represented as graphs and relations.
	- "Check" individual elements:
	- "Test": derive (sensitize) test cases and then execute them.

. Result checking and followup.

-       Specifics on model construction and usage in individual testing techniques: Chapter 8-11
