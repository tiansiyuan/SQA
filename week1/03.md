# Chapter 3. Quality Assurance (QA)

-		 QA as Dealing with Defect

-		 Defect Prevention

-		 Defect Detection and Removal

-		 Defect Containment

# Defect vs. QA

-	QA: quality assurance

	-   focus on correctness aspect of Quality
	-   QA as dealing with defects

	    -  post-release: impact on consumers
	    -  pre-release: what producer can do

	-   what: testing & many others
	-   when: earlier ones desirable (lower cost) but may not be feasible
	-   how => classification below

-	How to deal with defects:

	-   prevention
	-   removal (detect them first)
	-   containment


# QA Classification

![](../pics/3-1.png)

-	Fig 3.1 above (p.30): QA as barriers

	-   dealing with errors, faults, or failures
	-   removing or blocking defect sources
	-   preventing undesirable consequences

# Error/Fault/Failure & QA

-	Preventing fault injection

	-	error blocking (errors, not faults)
	-	error source removal

-	Removal of faults (pre: detection)

	-	inspection: faults discovered/removed
	-	testing: failures trace back to faults

-	Failure prevention and containment:

	-	local failure, not global failure
		via dynamic measures to tolerate faults

	-	failure impact, not safety assurance


# Defect Prevention Overview

-	Error blocking

	-     error: missing/incorrect actions
	-     direct intervention to block errors
	      => fault injections prevented

	-     rely on technology/tools/etc.

-	Error source removal

	-     root cause analysis
	      => identify error sources

	-     removal through education/training/etc.

-	Systematic defect prevention via process improvement.

-	Details: Chapter 13.


# Formal Method Overview

-	Motivation

	-	fault present:

		-     revealed through testing/inspection/etc.

	-	fault absent: formally verify.

		(formal methods => fault absent)

-	Basic ideas

	-	behavior formally specified:

		-	 pre/post conditions, or
		-	 as mathematical functions.

	-	verify "correctness":

		-	 intermediate states/steps,
		-	 axioms and compositional rules.

	-	Approaches: axiomatic/functional/etc.

-	Details: Chapter 15.


# Inspection Overview

-	Artifacts (code/design/test-cases/etc.) from req./design/coding/testing/etc. phases.

-	Informal reviews:

	-	 self conducted reviews.
	-	 independent reviews.
	-	 orthogonality of views desirable.

-	Formal inspections:

	-      Fagan inspection and variations.
	-      process and structure.
	-      individual vs. group inspections.
	-      what/how to check: techniques.

-	Details: Chapter 14.


# Testing Overview

-	Product/Process characteristics:

	-	object: product type, language, etc.
	-	scale/order:
		unit, component, system, ...

	-	who: self, independent, 3rd party

-	What to check:

	-    	verification vs. validation
	-	external specifications (black-box)
	-	internal implementation (white/clear-box)

-	Criteria: when to stop?

	-	coverage of specs/structures.
	-	reliability => usage-based testing

-	Much, much more in Part II.


# Fault Tolerance Overview

-	Motivation

	-	fault present but removal infeasible/impractical

	-	fault tolerance => contain defects

-	FT techniques: break fault-failure link

	-  	recovery: rollback and redo
	-	NVP: N-version programming
		fault blocked/out-voted

-	Details: Chapter 16.


# Safety Assurance Overview

-	Extending FT idea for safety:

	-	fault tolerance to failure \tolerance"

-	Safety related concepts:

	-      	safety: accident free
	-	accident: failure w/ severe consequences
	-	hazard: precondition to accident

-	Safety assurance:

	-      hazard analysis
	-      hazard elimination/reduction/control
	-      damage control

-	Details: Chapter 16.
